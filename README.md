# The First Step Out of My Comfort Zone
*By Sophia Marie R. Necesario - April 14, 2022*

### Ah ~ Comfort Zone

`Comfort Zone` - a place where we feel **safe** and by the word, **comfortable**.

I love this place. It's my safehaven. It's a place where I don't feel pressured to do something I do not want. It's my "Domain Expansion". My comfort zone is a place where I escape to whenever I feel stressed and bothered. There I do whatever I like, setting aside those that trouble me. I watch movies, play games, distract myself, anything. Back then, I was the person who retreats back to this place whenever overwhelmed with the outside world things. **Before I knew it, I became accustomed and content to staying in my comfort zone where things were how the way I wanted them to be.**

*But it changed when I trained again.*

I went back to practice Taekwondo again after 3-4 years. 

I can still feel how nervous and anxious I was while walking to the gym of University of Nueva Caceres. I didn't know what to expect. I knew there would be new people, new faces, new training ground, and new training routine but it would be my first time seeing and experiencing them. I'm a curious and friendly individual but interacting with unfamiliar people tickles my nerves at times especially when our interaction is/becomes awkward (the uncomfortable atmosphere chips off some of my confidence). I'm still up for making new friends but there are times when awkwardness pushes me to mission abort. But you know, I want to get along with my new teammates and coaches. So, when I entered the gym, I took a deep breath and looked for people with pants (we have unique pants for training).
