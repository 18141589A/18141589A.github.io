# A Step Out of My Comfort Zone
*By Sophia Marie R. Necesario - April 14, 2022*

### Ah ~ Comfort Zone

`Comfort Zone` - a place where we feel **safe** and by the word, **comfortable**.

I love this place. It's my safehaven. It's a place where I don't feel pressured to do something I do not want. It's my "Domain Expansion". My comfort zone is a place where I escape to whenever I feel stressed and bothered. There I do whatever I like, setting aside those that trouble me. I watch movies, play games, distract myself, anything. Back then, I was the person who retreats back to this place whenever overwhelmed with the outside world things. **Before I knew it, I became accustomed and content to staying in my comfort zone where things were how the way I wanted them to be.**

*But it changed when I trained again.*
